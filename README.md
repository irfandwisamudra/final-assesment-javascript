# Submission: Final Learning Assessment
## Course: Belajar Dasar Pemrograman JavaScript (Dicoding)

## Description

This repository contains the tasks and code I worked on during the final learning assessment in the **"Belajar Dasar Pemrograman JavaScript"** course from Dicoding. Each task demonstrates my understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts, ranging from comments, consistent code writing, unit testing, to applying recursion and OOP concepts in real-world scenarios.

- **Description**: Writing JavaScript code following consistent code style guidelines.
- **Details**: 
  - Using consistent indentation, spacing, and variable naming according to JavaScript standards.

### 3. [03-writing-test](./03-writing-test)
- **Description**: Writing tests using unit testing for the `sum` function in JavaScript.

### 4. [04-oop](./optional-04-oop)
- **Description**: Implementing an inventory management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
- **Details**: 
  - Creating `Item` and `Inventory` classes.
  - Adding functionality to add, remove, update, and display items in the inventory.

### 5. [05-recursive](./optional-05-recursive)
- **Description**: Using recursion to calculate factorials and generate Fibonacci sequences.
- **Details**: 
  - A function to calculate the factorial of a number.
  - A function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth element.

### 6. [06-full-coverage-testing](./optional-06-full-coverage-testing)
- **Description**: Writing tests for the `sum` function with full coverage scenarios.
- **Details**: 
  - Using the `node:test` and `node:assert` module to test various conditions on the `sum` function.

### 7. [07-real-world-scenario](./optional-07-real-world-scenario)
- **Description**: Creating a simple restaurant order management system using concepts learned.
- **Details**:
  - Storing order data in arrays and objects.
